# PHP - Introduction

PHP started out as a small open-source project that evolved as more and more people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf released the first version of PHP way back in 1994. Initially, PHP was supposed to be an abbreviation for "Personal Home Page", but it now stands for the recursive initialism "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".

Lerdorf began PHP development in 1993 by writing several Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs in C, which he used to maintain in his personal homepage. Later on, He extended them to work with web forms and to communicate with databases. This implementation of PHP was "Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter" or PHP/FI.

Today, PHP is the worldâ€™s most popular server-side programming language for building web applications. Over the years, it has gone through successive revisions and versions.

## PHP Versions

PHP is one of the most widely used languages over the web. Here are some of its application areas:

- Server-side scripting embedded in HTML.
- Managing dynamic content, databases, session tracking, building e-commerce sites.
- Outputting rich file types (images, PDF files), encrypting data, sending emails.
- Running on all major operating system platforms and web server programs.
- Handling system functions, forms, cookies, database operations, access control, encryption, and more.
- Providing a large number of reusable classes and libraries available on "PEAR" and "Composer".
