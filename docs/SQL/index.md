# Introduction to SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. Developed initially in the 1970s, SQL has become the standard language for interacting with databases across various platforms and environments. It provides a structured approach to defining, querying, updating, and managing data stored in relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and SQLite.

SQL operates through a set of declarative commands that enable users to perform essential operations such as retrieving data with `SELECT` statements, inserting new records with `INSERT INTO`, updating existing records with `UPDATE`, and deleting records with `DELETE FROM`. These commands form the foundation for creating, modifying, and maintaining database schemas and ensuring data integrity.

Beyond basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, SQL supports advanced capabilities including:

- **Aggregation functions** (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.) for data analysis
- **Joins** to combine data from multiple tables
- **Transaction management** for ensuring data consistency and reliability
- **Indexing** for optimizing query performance
- **Views, stored procedures, and triggers** for encapsulating complex logic within the database

SQLâ€™s versatility and standardized syntax make it indispensable in various domains such as software development, data analysis, business intelligence, and system administration. Its ability to handle both simple and complex queries efficiently makes SQL a cornerstone of modern data management practices.

    SELECT * 
    FROM Customers 
    WHERE Country = 'Germany' 
    AND City = 'Berlin';
    ```

- **ORDER BY**: Sorts the result set.
  - **Example**: 
    ```sql
    SELECT * 
    FROM Customers 
    ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;
    ```

### Joins and Subqueries
- **INNER JOIN**: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
  - **Example**: 
    ```sql
    SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName 
    FROM Orders 
    INNER JOIN Customers 
    ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
    ```

- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table.
  - **Example**: 
    ```sql
    SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID 
    FROM Customers 
    LEFT JOIN Orders 
    ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
    ```

- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.
  - **Example**: 
    ```sql
    SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName 
    FROM Orders 
    RIGHT JOIN Customers 
    ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
    ```

- **FULL JOIN**: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.
  - **Example**: 
    ```sql
    SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID 
    FROM Customers 
    FULL JOIN Orders 
    ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
    ```

- **Subquery**: A query nested inside another query.
  - **Example**: 
    ```sql
    SELECT CustomerName 
    FROM Customers 
    WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID 
                         FROM Orders 
                         WHERE OrderAmount > 500);
    ```

### Data Grouping and Aggregation
- **GROUP BY**: Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.
  - **Example**: 
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country 
    FROM Customers 
    GROUP BY Country;
    ```

- **HAVING**: Filters records after the `GROUP BY` statement.
  - **Example**: 
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country 
    FROM Customers 
    GROUP BY Country 
    HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) < 5;
    ```

### Data Constraints
- **NOT NULL**: Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.
  - **Example**: 
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Orders (
        OrderID int NOT NULL, 
        OrderNumber int NOT NULL
    );
    ```

- **UNIQUE**: Ensures all values in a column are unique.
  - **

Example**: 
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Customers (
        CustomerID int UNIQUE, 
        CustomerName varchar(255)
    );
    ```

- **PRIMARY KEY**: Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
  - **Example**: 
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Customers (
        CustomerID int PRIMARY KEY, 
        CustomerName varchar(255)
    );
    ```

- **FOREIGN KEY**: Uniquely identifies a record in another table.
  - **Example**: 
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Orders (
        OrderID int, 
        CustomerID int, 
        FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
    );
    ```

- **CHECK**: Ensures that the values in a column satisfy a specific condition.
  - **Example**: 
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Orders (
        OrderID int, 
        OrderAmount int CHECK (OrderAmount > 0)
    );
    ```

- **DEFAULT**: Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified.
  - **Example**: 
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Orders (
        OrderID int, 
        OrderStatus varchar(255) DEFAULT 'Pending'
    );
    ```

## RDBMS 

A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a software system that facilitates the creation, management, and use of relational databases. RDBMSes are built on the principles of relational algebra and structured query language (SQL), providing a structured approach to storing and retrieving data.

### Key Components of RDBMS
- **Tables**: Data in RDBMSes is organized into tables, which consist of rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column represents a specific attribute or field of the data.
- **Relationships**: RDBMSes support relationships between tables through keys. Primary keys uniquely identify each row in a table, while foreign keys establish relationships between tables.
- **SQL**: SQL is the standardized language used to interact with RDBMSes. It allows users to define, manipulate, query, and control data within the database.
- **Data Integrity**: RDBMSes enforce data integrity constraints such as entity integrity (ensuring each row is unique with a primary key), referential integrity (maintaining relationships between tables), and domain integrity (ensuring valid data types and values).
- **Transactions**: RDBMSes support transactions, which are atomic units of work that ensure all operations within a transaction either succeed completely or fail completely, preserving data consistency.
- **Indexing**: Indexes are used to optimize data retrieval by providing fast access paths to data based on indexed columns.

### Applications of RDBMS
RDBMSes are widely used across various industries and applications:
1. **Web Applications**: Storing user data, session management, and content management systems.
2. **Enterprise Applications**: Managing business data, transactions, and customer relationships.
3. **Data Warehousing**: Storing and analyzing large volumes of data for business intelligence and decision-making.
4. **E-commerce**: Handling product catalogs, order processing, and customer transactions.
